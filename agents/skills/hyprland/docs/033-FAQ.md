### Symbol lookup errors[](#symbol-lookup-errors)

If you are getting an error like:

or

or sometimes without errors, just crashing at start / randomly

This means that you have built Hyprland yourself and your stack has gotten mismatched. Each hypr* app depends on a bunch of libraries. If you update those libraries, and you don’t rebuild the hypr* stack, you will get these errors or crashes.

If you want to avoid these errors altogether, *use packages and don’t build yourself*. By building yourself, the responsibility for maintaining this consistency falls on **you**!

When building yourself, you need to *build all hypr* components*, you cannot use some from packages and some from repos.

**For Arch users**: `-git` packages count as building yourself.

The order in which you **must** build the stack is as follows:

Other things, e.g. hyprapps (hyprlock, hyprsunset, …) can be built in any order after hyprland.

***Never, under any circumstances***, symbolically link different .so versions together, this will lead to memory bugs and crashes. I don’t care what some random person tells you online. Don’t do it.

### My apps are pixelated[](#my-apps-are-pixelated)

This just means they are running through XWayland, which physically cannot scale by fractional amounts.

To force them to run in native Wayland mode, see [the Master Tutorial](https://wiki.hypr.land/Getting-Started/Master-Tutorial/#force-apps-to-use-wayland).

If they can’t, see [the XWayland page](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/XWayland).

### Nothing renders / screen is empty / crash on opening first app[](#nothing-renders--screen-is-empty--crash-on-opening-first-app)

Possible causes:

> Your themes are not set up properly, making apps crash.

Use something like `qt6ct` (Qt) and `nwg-look` (GTK) (\*for GTK you can also set up themes with envvars) to set up your themes.

> Your PC is very, *very* old.

In that case, see the [Installation Page](https://wiki.hypr.land/Getting-Started/Installation) and try compiling with LEGACY\_RENDERER

*For more info about bugs and crashes, see this* [*wiki page*](https://wiki.hypr.land/Crashes-and-Bugs)

### My external monitor is blank / doesn’t render / receives no signal (laptop)[](#my-external-monitor-is-blank--doesnt-render--receives-no-signal-laptop)

For Nvidia graphics - This issue appears to be resolved when using Nvidia Drivers 525.60.11 or later, but it may persist with older drivers.

For systems with limited hardware (Ex. iGPU, USB-C, USB Hubs) - Set `env = AQ_NO_MODIFIERS,1` in your config. To diagnose if you have the exact problem above you can get a [DRM log](https://wiki.hypr.land/Crashes-and-Bugs/#debugging-drm-issues) and look for

Outside those, there is a way to fix it that *might* work for you though:

**Option 1:** Use *only* the external monitor

By using `AQ_DRM_DEVICES=/dev/dri/card1` (or `card0`) environment variable you can force Hyprland to use only your dGPU, meaning your laptop’s screen will be gone but your external one will work.

**Option 2:** Use all outputs, at the cost of battery life.

By switching your laptop to only use the dGPU in the BIOS, you *might* be able to get everything to work, at the cost of high battery usage.

*Please note these are highly model-specific and might or might not work. If they don’t, you’re unfortunately out of luck.*

You might try a USB-C to HDMI adapter though, maybe that could route the external monitor through the iGPU.

### How do I screenshot?[](#how-do-i-screenshot)

**Option 1:** Install `grim` and `slurp`.

Use a keybind (or execute) `grim -g "$(slurp)"`, and select a region. A screenshot will pop into your `~/Pictures/` (You can configure grim and slurp, see their GitHub pages).

If you want those screenshots to go directly to your clipboard, consider using `wl-copy`, from [`wl-clipboard`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard). Here’s an example binding: `bind = , Print, exec, grim -g "$(slurp -d)" - | wl-copy` For a more complete utility, try our own screenshotting utility: [Grimblast](https://github.com/hyprwm/contrib).

**Option 2:** You can also use hyprshot, more info [here](https://github.com/Gustash/Hyprshot).

**Option 3:** Install `flameshot`.

Flameshot has many built-in features like allowing you to draw with a paintbrush, add lines, add shapes, etc.

Flameshot was built originally for X and **it has many issues on Wayland** and users with HiDPI and multi-monitor setups have had mixed experiences with Flameshot. The options above are smoother and more native to Wayland. If you still want to use Flameshot, here are some configuration recommendations by users who’ve found workarounds.

For recording videos, [wf-recorder](https://github.com/ammen99/wf-recorder), [wl-screenrec](https://github.com/russelltg/wl-screenrec) or [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) could be used.

### Screenshare / OBS no worky[](#screenshare--obs-no-worky)

Check [Screensharing](https://wiki.hypr.land/Useful-Utilities/Screen-Sharing).

Also install `qt6-wayland` if you plan to use obs.

### How do I change my wallpaper?[](#how-do-i-change-my-wallpaper)

See [Wallpapers](https://wiki.hypr.land/Useful-Utilities/Wallpapers).

### How heavy is this?[](#how-heavy-is-this)

Not that much heavier than Xorg. If you want maximum performance, consider turning off the blur and animations.

### My monitor no worky[](#my-monitor-no-worky)

Try changing the mode in your config. If your preferred one doesn’t work, try a lower one. A good way to list all modes is to get `wlr-randr` and do a `wlr-randr --dryrun`

### My monitor has flickering brightness when I turn on VRR[](#my-monitor-has-flickering-brightness-when-i-turn-on-vrr)

Change the VRR option to `2` (fullscreen), so that it is only used in games. This happens because the brightness on some monitors can depends on the refresh rate, and rapidly changing refresh rates (for example, when the screen momentarily updates after pressing a key) will cause rapid changes in brightness.

If you want VRR always enabled regardless, the flickering can be mitigated or even removed by changing the VRR range in your monitor’s EDID. More information in [the ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_mode_setting#Forcing_modes_and_EDID).

### How do I update?[](#how-do-i-update)

Open a terminal where you cloned the repo.

If you are using the AUR (hyprland-git) package, you will need to cleanbuild to update the package. Paru has been problematic with updating before, use Yay.

### How do I screen lock?[](#how-do-i-screen-lock)

Use a Wayland-compatible locking utility using WLR protocols, e.g. `swaylock`. Be aware that they will not prevent tty-changing using Ctrl-Alt-F1…F7.

### How do I change me mouse cursor?[](#how-do-i-change-me-mouse-cursor)

See [hyprcursor](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprcursor)

1. Set the GTK cursor using [nwg-look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look).
2. Add `exec-once=hyprctl setcursor [THEME] [SIZE]` to your config and restart Hyprland.

If using flatpak, run `flatpak override --filesystem=~/.themes:ro --filesystem=~/.icons:ro --user` and put your themes in both `/usr/share/themes` and `~/.themes`, and put your icons and cursors in both `/usr/share/icons` and `~/.icons`.

For Qt applications, Hyprland exports XCURSOR\_SIZE as 24, which is the default. You can overwrite this by exporting XCURSOR\_SIZE to a different value with `env`.

You can also try running `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme 'theme-name'` or adding it after `exec-once=` in your config.

If you do not want to install a GTK settings editor, change the config files according to the [XDG specification (Arch Wiki link)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Cursor_themes#Configuration). Make sure to also edit `~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini` and `~/.gtkrc-2.0` if *not* using a tool (like `nwg-look`).

### GTK Settings no work / whatever[](#gtk-settings-no-work--whatever)

[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/GTK-3-settings-on-Wayland](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/GTK-3-settings-on-Wayland)

### My \[program name] is freezing[](#my-program-name-is-freezing)

Make sure you have a notification daemon running, for example `dunst`. Autostart it with the `exec-once` keyword.

### Waybar workspaces no worky???[](#waybar-workspaces-no-worky)

Waybar has a set of caveats or settings that you need to be aware of. See [Status bars](https://wiki.hypr.land/Useful-Utilities/Status-Bars) for solutions.

### How do I autostart my favorite apps?[](#how-do-i-autostart-my-favorite-apps)

Using the window rules to assign apps to workspaces, you can open a bunch of applications on various workspaces. The following method will start these apps silently (i.e. without the flickering from workspace to workspace).

Put the following in your `hyprland.conf`: (example)

### How do I move my favorite workspaces to a new monitor when I plug it in?[](#how-do-i-move-my-favorite-workspaces-to-a-new-monitor-when-i-plug-it-in)

If you want workspaces to automatically go to a monitor upon connection, use the following:

In hyprland.conf:

where `handle_monitor_connect.sh` is: (example)

This makes workspaces 1, 2, 4, and 5 go to monitor 1 when connecting it.

Please note this requires `socat` to be installed.

### My tablet no worky??[](#my-tablet-no-worky)

Use [Open Tablet Driver](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver) to configure your tablet. In the future it will be supported in the config. Until then, OTD is the way to go.

### Some of my apps take a really long time to open…?[](#some-of-my-apps-take-a-really-long-time-to-open)

Make sure that your portals launch *after* this gets executed. For some people, they might launch before that has happened.

In such cases, a script like this:

launched with `exec-once` should fix all issues. Adjust the sleep durations to taste.

### How do I export envvars for Hyprland?[](#how-do-i-export-envvars-for-hyprland)

See [Environment Variables](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Environment-variables)

The `env` keyword is used for this purpose. For example:

### How to disable middle-click paste?[](#how-to-disable-middle-click-paste)

Setting `misc:middle_click_paste` to `false` disables the feature altogether with the exception of some browsers (notably firefox) having a separate built-in way of emulating that feature which has to be disabled within the browser’s settings.

### How do I make Hyprland draw as little power as possible on my laptop?[](#how-do-i-make-hyprland-draw-as-little-power-as-possible-on-my-laptop)

***Useful Optimizations***:

- `decoration:blur:enabled = false` and `decoration:shadow:enabled = false` to disable fancy but battery hungry effects.
- `misc:vfr = true`, since it’ll lower the amount of sent frames when nothing is happening on-screen.

### My apps take a long time to start / can’t screenshare[](#my-apps-take-a-long-time-to-start--cant-screenshare)

See [The XDPH Page](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland/#debugging).

You most likely have multiple portal impls / an impl is failing to launch.

### My screenshot utilities won’t work with multiple screens[](#my-screenshot-utilities-wont-work-with-multiple-screens)

Some programs like Flameshot (currently) have limited Wayland support, so on most Wayland compositors, you will have to do a few tweaks. For Hyprland, you can add these window rules to your config to make these programs work with both of your screens.

### I cannot bind SUPER as my mod key on my laptop[](#i-cannot-bind-super-as-my-mod-key-on-my-laptop)

Many laptops have a built-in function to toggle `SUPER` between single key press mode and hold mode. This is usually indicated by a padlock on the `SUPER` key.

First, install and run `wev`, then press `SUPER`. If you see a key press event followed by an instant key release event, then it’s likely your `SUPER` key is set to single press mode.

On most laptops, this can be fixed by pressing `FN+SUPER` and verified in `wev`. You should be able to hold `SUPER` and not see an instant release event. In case `FN+SUPER` doesn’t work, consult your laptop’s manual.

### My VM doesn’t receive keybinds I have set in Hyprland[](#my-vm-doesnt-receive-keybinds-i-have-set-in-hyprland)

This is expected, as Hyprland takes precedence.

A simple fix is to create an empty “passthrough” submap:

Set `MOD` and `KEY` to desired values.

By pressing the selected combo, you will enter a mode where Hyprland ignores your keybinds and passes them on to the VM. Pressing `SUPER + Escape` will leave that mode.

### Some of my drop-down/pop-up windows in apps disappear/don’t open at cursor position[](#some-of-my-drop-downpop-up-windows-in-apps-disappeardont-open-at-cursor-position)

In some apps like Steam or VSCode, the drop-down windows may disappear if you hover over them. This can be fixed with window rules.

First, find the title and class of the pop-up window with `hyprctl clients`. You can try something like `sleep 3 && hyprctl clients` so you have time to open the pop-up. It should look something like this:

If the pop-up disappears as you hover over it, you can add to your config:

This has a downside of not being able to click on anything in the main UI until you’ve interacted with the pop-up.

If the pop-up disappears immediately, you can use:

If the pop-up doesn’t open at the cursor position, try the following:

This is required for apps running under xwayland only and there is usually no need to use the first solution if opening at the cursor position.

### Steam’s file picker no worky[](#steams-file-picker-no-worky)

On instances where you have a Steam library on another drive that you have to add, Hyprland’s file picker would not normally appear when selecting a directory from Steam.

Steam has its own file picker, however, it’s not functional. Install `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` to show the desktop’s file picker.

### Workspaces or clients are disappearing or monitor related dispatchers cause crashes[](#workspaces-or-clients-are-disappearing-or-monitor-related-dispatchers-cause-crashes)

It seems there is a Kernel bug making the system think there is an extra phantom monitor, that causes all sorts of issues, crashes and weird behaviors like disappearing workspaces or clients when adding or removing an external monitor.

First check the list of monitors detected by Hyprland by running:

If you see a monitor that should not be there (usually named `Unknown-1`), you can work around the issue by adding in your `hyprland.conf`:

### I get a .so file missing error on launch[](#i-get-a-so-file-missing-error-on-launch)

If you are using a -git package, this is a common occurrence when ABI-breaking updates are done.

***Do not*** symlink different .so versions, this will cause crashes!!!

Instead, find all hypr* packages with `-git` you have installed, remove them (possibly remove dependencies of them, too) and simply install them again.

If using yay, make sure to `CleanBuild` every package. If using paru, manually remove the cache of hypr* packages in `~/.cache/paru`.

If you are not using any -git packages, this is a mistake in your distro’s packaging and should be solved there.

### My cursor is a hyprland icon?[](#my-cursor-is-a-hyprland-icon)

This means you have no hyprcursor theme installed, and hyprland failed to find an XCursor theme as well. Install a cursor theme.

### Smart gaps please?[](#smart-gaps-please)

[Here](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/#smart-gaps).

### Hyprwinwrap is not visible through blurred windows[](#hyprwinwrap-is-not-visible-through-blurred-windows)

This is a side effect of the [decoration:blur:new\_optimizations](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Variables/#blur). You have two options to resolve it.

1. Set `decoration:blur:new_optimizations` to `false` - This will preserve the exact same appearance, but may have a slight performance cost.
2. Set `decoration:blur:ignore_opacity` to `false` - This will drastically affect the appearance, but should maintain the original performance.

### I can’t create Discord binds[](#i-cant-create-discord-binds)

You most likely have `env = ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT, wayland` in your config.

Try running Discord like this `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT= discord`.

Warning

Keep in mind that this will run Discord under XWayland.

If it works, navigate to the Discord desktop entry (usually located in `/usr/share/applications/`). Duplicate it and replace `Exec=/usr/bin/discord` with `Exec=env ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT= /usr/bin/discord`. You can also give it a new name, e.g. `Name=DiscordX`, to avoid confusion as to which is which.

### Fullscreen applications/Steam Games open with secondary monitor’s resolution[](#fullscreen-applicationssteam-games-open-with-secondary-monitors-resolution)

The issue is likely the default monitor for X11 is not your desired primary monitor, to fix this, do the following:

Add `exec-once=xrandr --output [MONITOR_ID] --primary` to your config, replacing \[MONITOR\_ID] with your main monitor’s ID (e.g. DP-3). You can find your monitor ID by running `hyprctl monitors`.

By adding this to your hyprland config, it will set the default monitor for X11 applications to your main monitor.
