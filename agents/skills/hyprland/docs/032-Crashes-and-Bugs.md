## Getting the log[](#getting-the-log)

Firstly, make sure you have enabled logs in the Hyprland config. Set `debug:disable_logs` to `false`.

If you are in a TTY, and the Hyprland session that crashed was the last one you launched, the log can be printed with

if you are in a Hyprland session, and you want the log of the last session, use

## Obtaining the Hyprland Crash Report[](#obtaining-the-hyprland-crash-report)

If you have `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` set, the crash report directory is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/hyprland`. If not, it’s `$HOME/.cache/hyprland`.

Go to the crash report directory and you should find a file named `hyprlandCrashReport[XXXX].txt` where `[XXXX]` is the PID of the process that crashed.

Attach that file to your issue.

## Crashes at launch[](#crashes-at-launch)

Diagnose the issue by what is in the log:

- `backend failed to start` -&gt; launch in the TTY and refer to the logs in RED.
- `Monitor X has NO PREFERRED MODE, and an INVALID one was requested` -&gt; your monitor is bork.
- Other -&gt; see the coredump. Use `coredumpctl`, find the latest one’s PID and do `coredumpctl info PID`.
- failing on a driver (e.g. `radeon`) -&gt; report an issue.
- failing on `Hyprland` -&gt; report an issue.

## Crashes not at launch[](#crashes-not-at-launch)

Report an issue on GitHub or on the Discord server.

## Obtaining a debug stacktrace[](#obtaining-a-debug-stacktrace)

> Systemd-only.

1. Build Hyprland in debug (`make debug`).
2. Start Hyprland and get it to crash.
3. In a tty or terminal, do `coredumpctl debug Hyprland`.
   
   - If gdb asks you for symbols, say `y`.
   - If it asks about paging, say `c`.
4. Once you get to `(gdb)`, start file logging with `set logging enabled`.
   
   - For a specific file, use `set logging file output.log`.
5. Run `bt -full`, then `exit` once finished, and attach the output.

## Obtaining a trace log[](#obtaining-a-trace-log)

Launch Hyprland with `HYPRLAND_TRACE=1 AQ_TRACE=1` environment variables set.

These variables will enable *very* verbose logging and it’s not recommended to enable them unless debugging, as they might cause slowdowns and *massive* log files.

Try to reproduce your issue as fast as possible so we don’t have to sift through 1 million lines of logs.

## Bugs[](#bugs)

First of all, ***READ THE [FAQ PAGE](https://wiki.hypr.land/FAQ)***

If your bug is not listed there, you can ask on the Discord server or open a [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/discussions).

## Bisecting an issue[](#bisecting-an-issue)

“Bisecting” is finding the first *git* commit that introduced a specific bug or regression using binary search. This is done in `git` using the `git bisect` command.

First, clone the Hyprland repo if you haven’t already:

Start the bisect process:

Enter the first known good commit hash that did not contain the issue:

Then, enter the known bad commit hash that does contain the issue. You can simply use HEAD:

*git* will now checkout a commit in the middle of the specified range. Now, reset and build Hyprland:

…and run the built executable from the TTY `./build/Hyprland`.

Try to reproduce your issue. If you can’t (i.e. the bug is not present), go back to the Hyprland repo and run `git bisect good`. If you can reproduce it, run `git bisect bad`. *git* will then checkout another commit and continue the binary search. If there’s a build error, run `git bisect skip`.

Reset, build and install Hyprland again and repeat this step until *git* identifies the commit that introduced the bug:

## Building the Wayland stack with ASan[](#building-the-wayland-stack-with-asan)

If requested, this is the deepest level of memory issue debugging possible.

*Do this in the tty, with no Hyprland instances running.*

Clone hyprland: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland`

`make asan`

Reproduce your crash. Hyprland will exit back to the tty.

Now, in either `cwd`, `~` or `./build`, search for file(s) named `asan.log.XXXXX` where XXXXX is a number.

Zip all of them up and attach to your issue.

## Debugging DRM issues[](#debugging-drm-issues)

DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) is the underlying kernel architecture to take a gpu buffer (something we can render to) and put it on your screen (via the gpu) instead of a window.

Freezes, glitches, and others, can be caused by issues with Hyprland’s communication with DRM, the driver or kernel. In those cases, a DRM log is helpful.

Warning

Please note, these logs are EXTREMELY verbose. Please reproduce your bug(s) ASAP to avoid getting a 1GB log.

After this, *attach* the `dmesg.log` file.
