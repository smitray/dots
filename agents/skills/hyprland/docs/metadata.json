The split is determined dynamically with the W/H ratio of the parent node. If W > H, it’s side-by-side. If H > W, it’s top-and-bottom. You can make them permanent by enabling preserve_split.\nConfig category name: dwindle\nname description type default pseudotile enable pseudotiling. Pseudotiled windows retain their floating size when tiled. bool false force_split 0 -> split follows mouse, 1 -> always split to the left (new = left or top) 2 -> always split to the right (new = right or bottom) int 0 preserve_split if enabled, the split (side/top) will not change regardless of what happens to the container. bool false smart_split if enabled, allows a more precise control over the window split direction based on the cursor’s position. The window is conceptually divided into four triangles, and cursor’s triangle determines the split direction. This feature also turns on preserve_split. bool false smart_resizing if enabled, resizing direction will be determined by the mouse’s position on the window (nearest to which corner). Else, it is based on the window’s tiling position. bool true permanent_direction_override if enabled, makes the preselect direction persist until either this mode is turned off, another direction is specified, or a non-direction is specified (anything other than l,r,u/t,d/b) bool false special_scale_factor specifies the scale factor of windows on the special workspace [0 - 1] float 1 split_width_multiplier specifies the auto-split width multiplier. Multiplying window size is useful on widescreen monitors where window W > H even after several splits. float 1.0 use_active_for_splits whether to prefer the active window or the mouse position for splits bool true default_split_ratio the default split ratio on window open. 1 means even 50/50 split. [0.1 - 1.9] float 1.0 split_bias specifies which window will receive the split ratio. 0 -> directional (the top or left window), 1 -> the current window int 0 precise_mouse_move bindm movewindow will drop the window more precisely depending on where your mouse is. bool false single_window_aspect_ratio whenever only a single window is shown on a screen, add padding so that it conforms to the specified aspect ratio. A value like 4 3 on a 16:9 screen will make it a 4:3 window in the middle with padding to the sides. Vec2D 0 0 single_window_aspect_ratio_tolerance sets a tolerance for single_window_aspect_ratio, so that if the padding that would have been added is smaller than the specified fraction of the height or width of the screen, it will not attempt to adjust the window size [0 - 1] int 0.1 Bind Dispatchers dispatcher description params pseudo toggles the given window’s pseudo mode left empty / active for current, or window for a specific window Layout messages Dispatcher layoutmsg params:",
