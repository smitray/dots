If you have `hyprland-guiutils` installed, you can make use of Hyprland’s built-in permission system.

For now, it only has a few permissions, but it might include more in the future.

## Permissions[](#permissions)

Permissions work a bit like Android ones. If an app tries to do something sensitive with the compositor (Hyprland), Hyprland will pop up a notification asking you if you want to let it do that.

Note

Before setting up permissions, make sure you enable them by setting `ecosystem:enforce_permissions = true`, as it’s disabled by default.

### Configuring permissions[](#configuring-permissions)

Important

Permissions set up in the config are **not** reloaded on-the-fly and require a Hyprland restart for security reasons.

Configuring them is simple:

for example:

Will allow `/usr/bin/grim` to always capture your screen without asking.

Will allow any app whose path starts with `/usr/bin/appsuite-` to capture your screen without asking.

### Permission modes[](#permission-modes)

There are 3 modes:

- `allow`: Don’t ask, just allow the app to proceed.
- `ask`: Pop up a notification every time the app tries to do something sensitive. These popups allow you to Deny, Allow until the app exits, or Allow until Hyprland exits.
- `deny`: Don’t ask, always deny the application access.

### Permission list[](#permission-list)

`screencopy`:

- Default: **ASK**
- Access to your screen *without* going through xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland. Examples include: `grim`, `wl-screenrec`, `wf-recorder`.
- If denied, will render a black screen with a “permission denied” text.
- Why deny? For apps / scripts that might maliciously try to capture your screen without your knowledge by using wayland protocols directly.

`plugin`:

- Default: **ASK**
- Access to load a plugin. Can be either a regex for the app binary, or plugin path.
- Do *not* allow `hyprctl` to load your plugins by default (attacker could issue `hyprctl plugin load /tmp/my-malicious-plugin.so`) - use either `deny` to disable or `ask` to be prompted.

`keyboard`:

- Default: **ALLOW**
- Access to connecting a new keyboard. Regex of the device name.
- If you want to disable all keyboards not matching a regex, make a rule that sets `DENY` for `.*` *as the last keyboard permission rule*.
- Why deny? Rubber duckies, malicious virtual / usb keyboards.

## Notes[](#notes)

**xdg-desktop-portal** implementations (including xdph) are just regular applications. They will go through permissions too. You might want to consider adding a rule like this:

if you are not allowing screencopy for all apps.

NixOS does not have static paths for the binaries, so regex has to be used. These example rules allow `grim` and `xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland` to copy the screen:

When rendering the configuration with Nix itself, string interpolation can also be used (be aware that if the path contains special regex characters (e.g. `+`) they need to be escaped):

On some **BSD** systems paths might not work. In such cases, you might want to disable permissions altogether, by setting

otherwise, you have no *config* control over permissions (popups will still work, although will not show paths, and “remember” will not be available).
