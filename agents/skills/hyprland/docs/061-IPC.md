Hyprland exposes 2 UNIX Sockets, for controlling / getting info about Hyprland via code / bash utilities.

## Hyprland Instance Signature (HIS)[](#hyprland-instance-signature-his)

## `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/[HIS]/.socket.sock`[](#xdg_runtime_dirhyprhissocketsock)

Used for hyprctl-like requests. See the [Hyprctl page](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Using-hyprctl) for commands.

basically, write `[flag(s)]/command args`.

Note

Hyprland evaluates connections to this socket completely synchronously, which means that any unclosed connections *will cause Hyprland to freeze* until the five-second timeout is reached. Ensure that you always open the socket immediately before writing requests and close it afterward.

## `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/[HIS]/.socket2.sock`[](#xdg_runtime_dirhyprhissocket2sock)

Used for events. Hyprland will write to each connected client live events like this:

`EVENT>>DATA\n` (`\n` is a linebreak)

e.g.: `workspace>>2`

## Events list[](#events-list)

namedescriptiondataworkspaceemitted on workspace change. Is emitted ONLY when a user requests a workspace change, and is not emitted on mouse movements (see `focusedmon`)`WORKSPACENAME`workspacev2emitted on workspace change.

Empty means default.`SUBMAPNAME`changefloatingmodeemitted when a window changes its floating mode. `FLOATING` is either 0 or 1.`WINDOWADDRESS`,`FLOATING`urgentemitted when a window requests an `urgent` state`WINDOWADDRESS`screencastemitted when a screencopy state of a client changes. Keep in mind there might be multiple separate clients. State is 0/1, owner is 0 - monitor share, 1 - window share`STATE,OWNER`windowtitleemitted when a window title changes.`WINDOWADDRESS`windowtitlev2emitted when a window title changes.`WINDOWADDRESS,WINDOWTITLE`togglegroupemitted when `togglegroup` command is used.  
returns `state,handle` where the `state` is a toggle status and the `handle` is one or more window addresses separated by a comma  
e.g. `0,64cea2525760,64cea2522380` where `0` means that a group has been destroyed and the rest informs which windows were part of it`0/1,WINDOWADDRESS(ES)`moveintogroupemitted when the window is merged into a group. returns the address of a merged window`WINDOWADDRESS`moveoutofgroupemitted when the window is removed from a group. returns the address of a removed window`WINDOWADDRESS`ignoregrouplockemitted when `ignoregrouplock` is toggled.`0/1`lockgroupsemitted when `lockgroups` is toggled.`0/1`configreloadedemitted when the config is done reloadingemptypinemitted when a window is pinned or unpinned`WINDOWADDRESS,PINSTATE`minimizedemitted when an external taskbar-like app requests a window to be minimized`WINDOWADDRESS,0/1`bellemitted when an app requests to ring the system bell via `xdg-system-bell-v1`. Window address parameter may be empty.`WINDOWADDRESS`

Warning

A fullscreen event is not guaranteed to fire on/off once in succession. Some windows may fire multiple requests to be fullscreened, resulting in multiple fullscreen events.
